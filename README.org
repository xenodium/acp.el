* This project needs your funding

As you pay for those useful LLM tokens, consider [[https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium][sponsoring]] development and maintenance of this project.

=acp.el= enables us to build better integrations and tools into our beloved Emacs text editor. With your help, I can make this effort more [[https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium][sustainable]].

Thank you!

* acp.el

acp.el implements the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) for Emacs as per [[https://agentclientprotocol.com][agentclientprotocol.com]].

ACP is a standardized protocol for communicating with LLM agents like Gemini CLI, Claude Code, etc.

*Note:* This package is in the very early stages, isn't yet API stable, and is bound to change.

* Install

** Prerequisites

Install an LLM agent command-line tool like:

- Gemini CLI: =gemini-cli= - [[https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli][github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli]]
- Claude Code: =claude-code-acp= - [[https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code][anthropic.com/claude-code]]

** Package Installation
Clone the repository and add to your Emacs load path:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/acp.el/")
(require 'acp)
#+end_src

* Sample Usage

** Initialization

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
  (setq client (acp-make-client :command "gemini"
                                :command-params '("--experimental-acp")
                                :environment-variables (when api-key
                                                         (list (format "GEMINI_API_KEY=%s" "your-api-key")))))

  (acp-send-request
   :client client
   :request (acp-make-initialize-request :protocol-version 1)
   :on-success (lambda (response)
                 (message "Initialize success: %s" response))
   :on-failure (lambda (error)
                 (message "Initialize failed: %s" error)))
#+end_src

Initialize success:

#+RESULTS:
: ((protocolVersion . 1)
:  (authMethods . [((id . oauth-personal)
:                   (name . Log in with Google)
:                   (description . :null))
:                  ((id . gemini-api-key)
:                   (name . Use Gemini API key)
:                   (description . Requires setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable))
:                  ((id . vertex-ai)
:                   (name . Vertex AI)
:                   (description . :null))])
:  (agentCapabilities (loadSession . :false)
:                     (promptCapabilities (image . t)
:                                         (audio . t)
:                                         (embeddedContext . t))))

Typically, you'd need to send a sequence of requests before you can send the agent prompts to interact with:

1. =acp-make-initialize-request=
2. =acp-make-authenticate-request= (not needed for Claude Code)
3. =acp-make-session-new-request=

You may now send the agent prompts with:

4. =acp-make-session-prompt-request=

* Subscriptions

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no :exports both
  (acp-subscribe-to-requests client
                             (lambda (request)
                               (message "Received request: %s" request)))

  (acp-subscribe-to-notifications client
                                  (lambda (notification)
                                    (message "Received notification: %s" notification)))
#+end_src

* Cleanup

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (acp-shutdown client)
#+end_src

* Logging

Logging can be enabled via:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (setq acp-logging-enabled t)
#+end_src

Look out for =*acp log*= and =*acp traffic*= buffers.

The =*acp traffic*= is particularly useful to inspecting incomng or outgoing traffic.

* APIs

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '("Function" "Type" "Description") :exports results
  (let ((rows))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
       (let ((name (symbol-name symbol)))
         (when (and (string-match "^acp-" name)
                    (not (string-match "^acp--" name))
                    (not (string-match "^acp-traffic" name))
                    (not (string-match "^acp-fakes" name))
                    (fboundp symbol))
           (push `(,name
                   ,(or (car (split-string
                              (or (documentation symbol t) "No documentation")
                              "\n"))
                        "No documentation"))
                 rows)))))
    (sort rows (lambda (a b) (string< (car a) (car b)))))

* FAQ

** Why not use [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/jsonrpc.el][jsonrpc.el]]?

That was my initial intention, though it doesn't seem possible with [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/1d6ec2a0406c8a53fcf793b05453dbcc7e809d76/lisp/jsonrpc.el#L586][Content-Length automatically appended]] to requests sent. If you do know of a way, I'd love to know.
